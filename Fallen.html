        <p>What if I told you that I've fallen
            And I like the way you say my name
            My heart skips a beat when I hear you calling
            And I like that it won't go away
        </p>
        <p>
            But never mind don't wanna give you any trouble
            Never mind never mind
            I'm okay with being by your side for as long as I can hide
            What if I told you that I've fallen
        </p>
        <p>
            What if I told you that I've fallen
            The heart shaped arrow through my chest
            I'll make your breakfast every morning
            And pick you up when you're a mess
        </p>
        <p>But I know that it won't ever stop
            You know I'll be there when you call me whether you like it or not
            Without a warning now I'm falling for this picture on my phone
            But don't mind me I'm just falling I'll be back up on my own
        </p>
        <p>Please don't say my name help me put out this flame
            I'd rather hold onto this feeling that you don't even believe in
            What if I told you that I've fallen
        </p>
        <p>What if I told you that I've fallen
            Nevermind nevermind nevermind
            What if I told you that I've fallen
            Nevermind nevermind nevermind
            What if I told you that I've fallen
            Nevermind nevermind nevermind
            What if I told you that I've fallen
            Nevermind nevermind nevermind
        </p>
        <p>What if I told you that I've fallen (nevermind)
            What if I told you that I've fallen (oh nevermind)
            What if I told you that I've fallen (oh nevermind)
            What if I told you that I've fallen (oh nevermind I said nevermind)
            I shouldn't tell you that I've fallen
        </p>
