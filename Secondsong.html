        <p>Nobody knows 
            Just why we're here 
            Could it be fate 
            Or random circumstance 
            At the right place 
            At the right time 
            Two roads intertwine 
        </p>
        <p>And if the universe conspired 
            To meld our lives 
            To make us 
            Fuel and fire 
            Then know 
            Wherever you will be 
            So too shall I be 
            
        </p>
        <p>Close your eyes 
            Dry your tears 
            'Cause when nothing seems clear 
            You'll be safe here 
            
        </p>
        <p>From the sheer weight 
            Of your doubts and fears 
            Weary heart 
            You'll be safe here 
            
        </p>
        <p>Remember how we laughed 
            Until we cried 
            At the most stupid things 
            Like we were so high 
            But love was all that we were on 
            We belong 
            
        </p>
        <p>And though the world would 
            Never understand 
            This unlikely union 
            Why it still stands 
            Someday we will be set free 
            Pray and believe 
            
        </p>
        <p>When the light disappears 
            And when this world's insincere 
            You'll be safe here 
            When nobody hears you scream 
            And I'll scream with you 
            You'll be safe here 
            
        </p>
        <p>Save your eyes 
            From your tears 
            When everything's unclear 
            You'll be safe here 
            From the sheer weight 
            Of your doubts and fears 
            Wounded heart 
            
        </p>
        <p> When the light disappears 
            And when this world's insincere 
            You'll be safe here 
            When nobody hears you scream 
            I'll scream with you 
            You'll be safe here 
            Ooh ooh 
           
        </p>
        <p> In my arms
            Through the long cold night 
            Sleep tight 
            You'll be safe here
           >
        </p>
        <p>When no one understands 
            I'll believe 
            You'll be safe 
            You'll be safe 
            You'll be safe here 
            Put your heart in my hands
            You'll be safe here
            
        </p>
