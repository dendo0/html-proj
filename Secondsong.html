        <p>Nobody knows <br>
            Just why we're here <br>
            Could it be fate <br>
            Or random circumstance <br>
            At the right place <br>
            At the right time <br>
            Two roads intertwine <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And if the universe conspired <br>
            To meld our lives <br>
            To make us <br>
            Fuel and fire <br>
            Then know <br>
            Wherever you will be <br>
            So too shall I be <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Close your eyes <br>
            Dry your tears <br> 
            'Cause when nothing seems clear <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the sheer weight <br>
            Of your doubts and fears <br>
            Weary heart <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember how we laughed <br>
            Until we cried <br>
            At the most stupid things <br>
            Like we were so high <br>
            But love was all that we were on <br>
            We belong <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And though the world would <br>
            Never understand <br>
            This unlikely union <br>
            Why it still stands <br>
            Someday we will be set free <br>
            Pray and believe <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the light disappears <br>
            And when this world's insincere <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
            When nobody hears you scream <br>
            And I'll scream with you <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Save your eyes <br>
            From your tears <br>
            When everything's unclear <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
            From the sheer weight <br>
            Of your doubts and fears <br>
            Wounded heart <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the light disappears <br>
            And when this world's insincere <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
            When nobody hears you scream <br>
            I'll scream with you <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
            Ooh ooh <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In my arms <br>
            Through the long cold night <br>
            Sleep tight <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            When no one understands <br>
            I'll believe <br>
            You'll be safe <br>
            You'll be safe <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
            Put your heart in my hands <br>
            You'll be safe here <br>
        </p>
