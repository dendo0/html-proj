        <p>I, I just woke up from a dream
            Where you and I had to say goodbye
            And I don't know what it all means
            But since I survived, I realized
        </p>
        <p>Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
            Nobody's promised tomorrow
            So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
            Like it's the last night
        </p>
        <p>If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
        </p>
        <p>Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
            I don't even wanna do this anymore
            'Cause you already know what you mean to me
            And our love's the only war worth fighting for
        </p>
        <p>Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
            Nobody's promised tomorrow
            So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
            Like it's the last night
        </p>
        <p>If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
        </p>
        <p>Right next to you
            Next to you
            Right next to you
            Oh-oh, oh
        </p>
        <p>If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
            I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
            If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you

            I'd wanna be next to you
