        <h2>Get You</h2>
        <p>Through drought and famine, natural disasters
            My baby has been around for me
            Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
            None of that could ever make me leave
        </p>
        <p>Every time I look into your eyes I see it
            You're all I need
            Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
        </p>
        <p>Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
        </p>
        <p>And when we're making love
            Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
            It's only the two of us
            Everything I need's between those thighs
            
        </p>
        <p>Every time I look into your eyes I see it
            You're all I need
            Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

        </p>
        <p>Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
            Oh yeah, oh yeah babe
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

        </p>
        <p>And I'll take some time
            Just to be thankful
            That I had days full of you, you
            Before it winds down into
            The memories, it's all just memories
            La-la-la-la-la

        </p>
        <p>If you've got someone you like
            (Don't you love when I come around)
            Somebody just tell somebody
            If you've got someone you like
            Feel something that's right
            Somebody just tell somebody (build you up then I take)

        </p>
        <p>Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
            (Oh yeah, oh yeah babe)
            Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you

        </p>
        <p>This feels like summer
            Boy you make me feel so alive
            Just be my lover
            Boy you'll lead me to paradise

        </p>
